                            <p class="intro"> This past year during the current mayoral administration, there has been a spike in criminal summons given out by the NYPD on minor offenses. This comes seven years after the Criminal Justice Reform Act was passed by city council that sends over minor offense cases to civil court instead of criminal court. 
                                The five minor offenses that are impacted the most are open container of alchohol, parks rules, littering, public urination, and unreasonable noise. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the years after the reform act was passed, there has been a 94% decline in criminal summonses as well as 93% decline of warrants for failure to appear in court according to a February 2020 report by John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
                                However in 2022, there has been more than 14,000 criminal summons given out by the NYPD which is more than double in 2019.

                                        According to the City, during the time city council passed CJRA, the NYPD had a total of 1.5 million open warrants for those who missed previous criminal summons hearings. District attorneys from four boroughs
                                        Staten Island eliminated more than 700,000 outstanding arrest warrants that were a decade or more older.
